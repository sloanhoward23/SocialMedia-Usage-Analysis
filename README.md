# Clean and Analyze Social Media Usage Data with Python

## Project Overview

This project involves cleaning and analyzing social media usage data using Python. The objective is to derive meaningful insights from the dataset and perform various analyses, including building and evaluating linear regression models.

## Contents

- **Data Generation:** Used the `random` library to generate synthetic social media usage data.
- **Data Cleaning:** Performed data cleaning operations to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to understand the patterns and trends in the dataset.
- **Linear Regression Models:** Built three linear regression models to predict the like count of certain categories.

## Key Highlights

- **Data Cleaning:** Ensured the dataset was free of missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualized and analyzed the data using `seaborn` and `matplotlib` to uncover key insights and trends.
- **Model Evaluation:** Added three linear regression models to predict the like count of specific categories. Despite their overfitting due to the simplicity of the dataset, this exercise demonstrated the ability to identify overfit models and understand the complexity requirements of a dataset.
- **Data Transformation:** Demonstrated how to convert text columns to numeric values for linear regression model training.

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience with data cleaning, analysis, and model building using Python. The overfitting of the linear regression models highlighted the importance of dataset complexity in model performance. By recognizing overfitting, I showcased my ability to evaluate and adjust models appropriately.
